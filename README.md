## FAQ

1. **Does this work with WSL?**

Yes, read this [article](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/07/01/containers-wsl).

TL;DR: Windows users may need Docker Desktop, which detects WSL 2 if installed and can use it as the backend. The WSL integration is optional. The key is having Docker installed, regardless of WSL.

2. **How can I close the container?**

Exiting VSCode will automatically close the container and save resources. To further clean up artifacts, run these commands:

```sh
# Stop and remove all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -qa)
docker rm $(docker ps -qa)

# Remove all local images
# Warning: This will remove images locally, and you'll need to re-pull the images if needed
docker rmi $(docker images -qa)
```

3. **How can I return to my local environment?**

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS).
- Run `Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally`.
